 Dhoni once wished to join a  reputed Cricket Coaching Camp to be held at a place "X" kms away from his house. He told about this to his father and got his consent to use his friend's bike for the Camp. The Camp was to be held on all days of the month. His friend's bike provides a mileage of Y km/litre and the cost of petrol was Rs. Z. Dhoni's father now wanted to know the total amount that was needed by Dhoni to spend on his travel to the Camp. Help him find the same and assume number of days in a month as 30 days.

MS Dhoni is a grade A player according to BCCI Central Contracts in 2016. MSD's net worth in 2016 is around 31 million and is said to be the richest Indian cricketer.
Apart from his salary as an Indian cricketer, Dhoni endorses various popular brands and earns a large amount from endorsements. Besides that individual and team bonuses are also given on the basis of individual and team performances. So precisely the sources of income for Dhoni are from - Salary, Bonuses and Awards through Winning and Endorsements.

Extras are runs scored by a means other than a batsman hitting the ball. A batsman is not given credit for extras other than runs scored off the bat from a no ball, and the extras are tallied separately on the scorecard and count only towards the team’s score. the types of extras are No ball, Wide, Bye, Leg-bye and Penalty. 1 Penalty corresponds to 5 runs.
Find the total runs that the Extras contribute to the team’s score, given the number of No-balls, wides, byes, leg-byes and penalty given off by the bowlers in innings.
Input format:
First line of the input contains an integer that corresponds to the number of No-balls.

Ajay, Binoy and Chandru were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Emily Mam. Their gang was known as 3-idiots. Ajay, Binoy and Chandru live in the same locality. A new student Dinesh joins their class and he wanted to be friends with them. He asked Binoy about his house address. Binoy wanted to test Dinesh's mathematical skills. Binoy told Dinesh that his house is at the midpoint of the line joining Ajay's house and Chandru's house. Dinesh was puzzled.
